"""Dictionary-based sentiment analysis with Python



Download the following CSV file from Kaggle:



https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines



This is a dataset of over a million headlines taken from the Australian news source ABC (Start Date: 2003-02-19 ; End Date: 2020-12-31).



Calculate the sentiment score for every headline in the data. You can do this using the spaCyTextBlob approach that we covered in class or any other dictionary-based approach in Python.
Create and save a plot of sentiment over time with a 1-week rolling average
Create and save a plot of sentiment over time with a 1-month rolling average
Make sure that you have clear values on the x-axis and that you include the following: a plot title; labels for the x and y axes; and a legend for the plot
Write a short summary (no more than a paragraph) describing what the two plots show. You should mention the following points: 1) What (if any) are the general trends? 2) What (if any) inferences might you draw from them?


General instructions

For this assignment, you should upload a standalone .py script which can be executed from the command line.
Save your script as sentiment.py
Make sure to include a requirements.txt file and details about where to find the data
You can either upload the scripts here or push to GitHub and include a link - or both!
Your code should be clearly documented in a way that allows others to easily follow the structure of your script and to use them from the command line
