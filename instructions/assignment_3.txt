# Run the sentiment script 
# If you want to, you can reduce runtime by setting the argument --n_headlines, which 
# specifies how many headlines from the top of the .csv file you want to load. 
# For a all the headlines (and thereby a long runtime):
python src/sentiment.py

# For a proof of concept and a decreased runtime:
python src/sentiment.py --n_headlines 100000
